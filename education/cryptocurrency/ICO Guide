# Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)

Many open-source blockchain projects are raising capital via cryptocurrency crowdfunding, popularly known as 'initial coin offerings' (or ICOs). Similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) for the stock market, investors of a new cryptocurrency can provide early funding in return for a pre-determined amount of the new coins before the cryptocurrency is deployed. Once the coin is live and can be mined and/or traded on exchanges, investors are issued the amount of new coin invested into their wallets. ICOs have been considered ‘the future of fundraising’ since accessibility and simplicity are advantageous in comparison to private venture capital or public stock offerings.
 
#### Why do individuals invest in ICOs?
ICOs are intriguing to investors since their investment is both a way to support an open-source project and capitalize on the cryptocurrency's potential increase in value. Some of the most appealing ICOs offer aspirational solutions to societal problems such as the Humaniq project,<https://humaniq.co/?_ga=2.129434761.488867700.1493844992-998258822.1493844750> whose mission is to offer a secure and simple banking tool for people who cannot hold a bank account due to lack of education or lack of identification. Another is Kin,<https://kin.kik.com/#Newsletter> a cryptocurrency designed by Kik Interactive to be used in everyday digital services such as messaging.
 
#### Regulation & Standards
While new ICOs are launched often, standards and government regulation of the crowdfunding activity is largely undefined today. This has left citizens of many countries, including the United States, unable to participate in ICOs. Additionally, many ICOs set rules including a cap on the amount of money they wish to raise and using Bitcoin or Ethereum as the only currency to use for investment.
